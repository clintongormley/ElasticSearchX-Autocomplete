NAME
    ElasticSearchX::Autocomplete - Efficient autocomplete with term
    frequency and geolocation

VERSION
    Version 0.01 - alpha

DESCRIPTION
    "ElasticSearchX::Autocomplete" helps you to build autocomplete indexes
    from your data, taking term frequency and (optionally) geolocation into
    account.

    This is an alpha module, and still requires documentation and tests.
    Here be dragons.
